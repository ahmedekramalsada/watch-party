# 🎬 Watch Party Ultimate

> **"Watch Together, Sync Forever."** 🚀🍿

A modern, high-performance **Watch Party** application that lets you watch movies synchronously with friends. Features real-time chat, instant seek synchronization, and a robust "Anti-Lag" system.

## ✨ Key Features

-   **🔄 Perfect Sync**: Video play/pause/seek events are synchronized instantly across all users.
-   **⚡ Force Sync Button**: One click to pull everyone to your exact timestamp if they fall behind.
-   **⏳ Smart Anti-Lag**: If anyone buffers, the video pauses for everyone automatically to keep the group together.
-   **💬 Live Chat**: Chat with your friends while watching.
-   **📚 Link Library**: Easily curate your movie list by editing a simple JSON file.
-   **🔗 Direct Link Support**: Paste any `.m3u8` or `.mp4` link directly in the room to play it.
-   **📱 Responsive Design**: Works beautifully on Desktop, Mobile, and Tablets.

## 🛠️ How to Add Movies

The application uses a **Link-Only Library** system. You don't need to upload heavy files!

1.  Open `media/catalog.json`.
2.  Add your movie links (HLS `.m3u8` or Direct `.mp4`) like this:

```json
[
  {
    "category": "Movies",
    "items": [
      {
        "id": "my-movie",
        "name": "My Awesome Movie",
        "url": "https://example.com/movie.m3u8",
        "poster": "https://example.com/poster.jpg"
      }
    ]
  }
]
```

3.  Restart the container (or just refresh the page if mounted as a volume).

## ❓ Troubleshooting Video Links

If a link works for you but not for your friends:
1. **CORS Policy**: Many websites block video playback on external domains. Use links from CDNs that allow cross-origin requests.
2. **Mixed Content**: If you deploy on HTTPS, all video links **MUST** also be HTTPS. Browsers block naked `http://` links on secure sites.
3. **Format Support**: Ensure the link is either a direct MP4 or an HLS (`.m3u8`) stream.
4. **Ad-Blockers**: Some ad-blockers can interfere with WebSocket connections or video scripts.
